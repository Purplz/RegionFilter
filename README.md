# Region Filter

Region Filter is a lightweight WoW addon for tagging the region and data centre location for groups in group finder.

Updated for TWW as I found myself missing the functionality of this AddOn.

If you are using the wonderful [CurseBreaker](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker) please add this addon as a GitHub source and avoid giving CurseForge (soon/now Overwolf) the traffic.

You can do this by calling:

`install gh:Purplz/RegionFilter`

Any bugs, please make a report here and if you have suggestions or PR's I'm happy to review them when I have the time.

# Future

The next major version will have a GUI for managing colours for each server region and datacentre group.

# Thanks
